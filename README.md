# Mastodoner

Mastodoner is a command line tool (and Python library) for archiving [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org), a decentralized micro-blogging social network. Mastodoner does not currently require any authentication with Mastodon; it gathers all data through publicly accessible endpoints. 

## Installation

Install the mastodoner with ```pip```:

```
pip install -U mastodoner
```

Alternatively, you can also clone the latest version from the [repository](https://github.com/harisbinzia/mastodoner) and install it directly from the source code:

```
pip install -e .
```

**Note: Mastodoner requires Python 3.8 or higher.**

## Intended Use

Mastodoner is developed to support academic research. The data collected through Mastodoner should only be used for research purposes. Mastodoner gathers all data through publicly accessible endpoints and strictly adheres to the rate limits set for each endpoint.
